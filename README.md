## FAQs

1. What are [blockchains]()?
   Simply, a single blockchain is like a linked list which is connected by the hash of the previous block of information. By hashing blocks and linking them together, they increase the difficulty of manipulation.

   A blockchain network is when this blockchain is spread across various nodes for redundency. The more decentralized the network, the more tamper resistant. This increases trust in the system, which reduces the need for trust between entities. Through a consensus mechanism, the network's state is constantly updated.

   In a sense a blockchain is a database AND a network rolled up into one. Blockchains key innovation is to commoditize trust and allow for coordination between peers in open adversial environments.

   Get a general sense of blockchain and their primitives by playing with a simple one created by [Anders Brownsworth](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/hash).

   [This article](https://unchained.com/blog/blockchain-spectrum/) explains why for many its hard to get bitcoin and blockchains in general. An exciting and eye opening read.

2. What is [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/)?
   Ethereum is the leading programmbale blockchain, allowing for developers to leverage the security of

   To get an understanding of how Ethereum fits into the evolution of the internet, read [Programmable Blockchains in context by Vinay Gupta](https://media.consensys.net/programmable-blockchains-in-context-ethereum-s-future-cd8451eb421e). Its a mind bending but amazing read. His talk on the history of computing and how it fits with blockchains also is worth a look.

3. What is [Web3](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/)?
   Web2 refers to the version of the internet most of us know today. An internet dominated by companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data.

   Web3, in the context of Ethereum, refers to decentralized apps that run on the blockchain. These are apps that allow anyone to participate without monetising their personal data.

4. Why Ethereum and Web3?

   JavaScript allows you to add interactivity. Ethereum and Solidity allows you to add collaboration and ownership. This allows real decentralization and helps fulfill the promise of the internet.

   Furthermore, web3 apps on the same blockchain are composible and interoperable. Because the network is the database, web3 apps can build upon eachother in a permissionless way. This leads to a Cambrian Explosion of innovation!

   A great podcast that puts everything into perspective is [Moon Math - The Bull Case for Cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycK3AUTdl1w) by Bankless featuring Ethereum Researcher Justin Drake.

5. What's a [Smart Contract](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/#top)?
   Smart contracts are programs that run on programmable blockchains like Ethereum.

   They have many uses and are limited to your imagination. There are smart contracts which create money markets, issue royalties and ownership for art, are parts of video games and more!

6. What is [MetaMask]()?
7. What do we use MetaMask for as end user and [developer]()?
8. How do we access [Ethereum Network via Metamask]()?
9. What is [Provider]() and how does it work?
10. How do we use [MetaMask APIs]() to interact with Web3?
11. Where and how do we hold state with Web3?
12. How do we interact with Smart Contracts?
13. How do we read Smart Contracts?
14. Where do we go to learn more?
15. Want to learn more about DApp development?
